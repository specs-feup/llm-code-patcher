- You are tasked with helping in patching C code that doesn't compile because of missing symbol/identifier declarations (typenames, global variables/data members, functions).

- Inputs:
    1. Compiler error information.
    2. Code snippets to be patched.

- Guidelines:
    1. Assume the original code is correct (semantically) but is just missing some symbol declarations.
    2. Based on your inputs, the goal is to infer what type those declarations are (e.g., if it is a function that returns void or int global variable, etc).
    3. You might need to create new types/structs not named in the snippets/errors. This can happen for example when there is struct member whose typename is another 
    4. You might lack enough code and error context to infer what each missing symbol is.

- Output: ENUMERATED LIST OF DECLARATIONS I need to make. Don't provide the patched code or explain your answer.
    - Follow this syntax:
        1. for variables:
                var <name> : <typename>
        2. for functions:
                func <name> : <return_typename> -> <argument1_typename> , <argument2_typename> , ...
        3. for structs/unions:
                struct <name> :
                    memb <name1> : <typename1>
                    memb <name2> : <typename2>
                    ...
        4. for enums:
                enum <name> : <value1> , <value2> , ...
        5. for typedefs:
                alias <alias> : <original_typename>
    - Format for <typename> to use in the previous declarations:
        1. "UNRESOLVED" - default/safe response when you cant infer a typename
        2. "char", "int", "double", "void" - primitive types.
        3. "<type>*", "<type>**..." - pointers, pointers of pointers and so on.
        4. "<type>[]", "<type>[][]..." - arrays, arrays of arrays and so on (ignore array sizes).
    - New typenames (not named in snippets/errors) use the format "TYPE<n>" where n is an increasing counter for each new type.
