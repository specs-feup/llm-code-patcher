- You are tasked with helping in patching C code that doesn't compile because of missing symbol/identifier declarations (typenames, global variables/data members, functions).

- Inputs:
    1. Compiler error information.
    2. Code snippets to be patched.

- Guidelines:
    1. Assume the original code is correct (semantically), missing only some symbol declarations.
    2. Based on your inputs, the goal is to infer what type those declarations are (e.g., if it is a function that returns void or int global variable, etc).
    3. You might need to create new types not named in the snippets/errors. This can happen for example when a struct's member is used but its typename is not present anywhere.
    4. You might lack enough code and error context to infer what each missing symbol is.

- Output: ENUMERATED LIST OF DECLARATIONS I need to make. Don't provide the patched code or explain your answer.
    - Follow this syntax:
        1. for variables:
                var <name> : <type>
        2. for functions:
                func <name> : <return_type> -> <argument1_type> , <argument2_type> , ...
        3. for structs/unions (can have 0 member):
                struct <name> :
                    memb <name1> : <type1>
                    memb <name2> : <type2>
                    ...
        4. for enums:
                enum <name> : <value1> , <value2> , ...
        5. for typedefs:
                alias <alias> : <original_type>
    - Format for <type> to use in the previous declarations:
        1. "char", "uchar", "int", "uint", "long", "ulong", "double", "void" - primitive types.
        2. "<typename>*", "<typename>**..." - pointers, pointers of pointers and so on.
        3. "<typename>[]", "<typename>[][]..." - arrays, arrays of arrays and so on (ignore array sizes).
        4. "UNRESOLVED", "UNRESOLVED[]...", "UNRESOLVED*..." - default/safe response when you cant infer a typename.

    - New typenames (not named in snippets/errors) use the format "TYPE<n>" where n is a counter that increases for each new type.
